# ProjectInit ðŸŽˆ
> Scaffold a new project, without all the unnecessary clutter other tools give.

- ðŸŽ¨ Variety of starters
- âš¡ Ready in 15 seconds
- ðŸ’¡ Easy to Use
- ðŸ”§ All in the command line

The purpose of this is to quickly and easily scaffold projects on Node.js without clutter and unnecessary files that usually other create-* tools contain. For example:
- create-vite: React and Vite SVGs, 2 different CSS files, and a README.md
- create-react-app: reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js, App.test.js, again 2 different CSS files, and a README.md

These are made to showcase the possibilities with whatever they have, and whatever may be helpful to developers. If you find these pre-made things useful, then use them.
